📸 ExifModifier

ExifModifier is a Flutter-based app that helps you fill in missing GPS location data in your photos by identifying other images taken within a similar time frame. Instead of using visual similarity, the app leverages timestamps to suggest the most likely location data based on nearby photos.

🌍 Core Feature

🗺️ Auto-fill missing location data based on timestamp proximity
If a photo is missing GPS data, the app searches your local photo collection for other pictures taken around the same time (e.g., within a few minutes or hours) and suggests copying their location data.

This feature is ideal for users who took multiple photos in the same area but only some have valid GPS coordinates.
